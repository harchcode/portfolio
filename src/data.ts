            I worked on maintaining a mobile game project, fixing bugs and adding new features. The most ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù part? For some reasons, the original source code was gone ‚Äî so my team and I had to dive in and work directly with the built code (luckily it was not uglified). Quite an adventure. üòÖ

            This is a simple game where you control a circle and try to eat other circles to become the biggest one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built it as a way to showcase my skills in creating smooth, high-performance animations‚Äîusing WebGL for rendering and applying basic math and physics to handle motion and collisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also highlights my understanding of common game-related design patterns for optimization, such as Quad Trees for efficient collision detection, Object Pooling, and other performance techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, I took the opportunity to experiment with Rust and WebAssembly, just for fun and to explore how they could push performance even further.

            This is a library for drawing simple directed graphs. It is heavily inspired by react-digraph, but with way fewer features, not nearly as shiny, and definitely not made for React üòÜ.
          </p>
          <p>
            What it does have though, is a much better performance, smoother interactions, and a super tiny bundle size (thanks to having zero dependencies).
          </p>
          <p>
            I built it with Canvas and threw in some smart optimizations, so it can happily draw a huge number of nodes and edges without even breaking a sweat.

          <p>
            This project shows how to generate Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulty and also how to implement a solver. Later on, I gave it a twist by rewriting parts in Rust and WebAssembly, mostly as an experiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally made this way back in 2011, and honestly, I can‚Äôt even remember where I first found the algorithm for generating the puzzles with difficulty. So if you recognize it, please tell me.

            This is a simple game inspired by Flappy Bird (wished it was as successful). I first built it for Android back in 2014 using Java and libGDX. It was on the Play Store for a while‚Ä¶ until it eventually got removed (RIP üò¢).

            Gaguna (from common Indonesian words "ga guna") means useless, and
